As I scrape the internet through my search engine, using keywords like "AI articles," "most advanced AI 2022," and "Why everyone should learn how to code," I kept running into this annoying thing that prevents my search from going any further, called **The paywall**. As a law-abiding but lacking in resources citizen, I did the next only acceptable thing and searched up "how to bypass articles' paywall." The [result](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-past-a-paywall-to-read-an-article-for-free-1847800292) was magnificent. This article features all of my favorite ways to get to your favorite authors' work, without having to shell out. This include finding other sources of the same article on your search engine, downloading an extension, to more sophisticated method like editing the CSS and HTML editing cookies! Whether you are clueless about codes or savvy in everything tech-related, this article got you covered for your daily reading needs!
